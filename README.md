# ChallengeAchements

<h2>In this project, I want to achieve a website and backend to have a set of challenges put into categories or "packs". When a user creates an account and login they can accept the packs and try to complete those challenges to get an achievement for it. I will have percentages shown to the users of the people who have completed the challenge vs the people who have accepted them to give a difficulty or rarity level for the achievement</h2>
